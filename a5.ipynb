    "My dataset is pulled from the Census Bureau, and documents the percentage of rental vacancies by state and quarter. (Available here: https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/data/rates.html).\n",
    "I was interested in seeing the overall trends in rental demand over the latter half of the 2010s, especially when interest rates were as low as they were, and then the subsequent shock from the COVID-19 pandemic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Surprisingly enough, there wasn't as drastic an increase in vacancies as expected. While the period aligned with the Pandemic certainly saw local, or even global maxima, there were several instances of severe fluctuation on a quarterly basis. Massachusetts, for example, did spike from 4.3% to 6.6%, an approximate 50% increase in vacancies, at the start of the pandemic, but switftly saw that figure drop to 3.1% by Q2. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this might be explained by the inclusion of the District of Columbia within the dataset, which saw a dramatic rise in vacancies that did not peak until Q2 of 2021 and has yet to reach pre-pandemic lows. Given the urban nature of Washington D.C., it might be speculated that the true shocks of rentals are and were limited to urban areas, whereas most states are filled with less populous but nevertheless developed suburban regions with ample housing, or differences in tenant law or lease standards which affected their market's liquidity.
